# AdvancedScalaConcepts
This project is my attempt to go back to the basics and dig further into the functional programming world.
## Courses referred for this.
- Rock The JVM courses by Daniel
- Random blogs from functional programmers
## Index
- Advanced - Include scala concepts which is bit more advanced. It might not be advanced to you, however, I just put them here because I wasn't really using these much in my programs.
- Basic - This includes very basic concepts. Time to time a refresh helps for a giant leap.
